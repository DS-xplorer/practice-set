#(/) this operater is used to divide the number and this operater give us the quotient
#lets understans this by an example
8/2

#(%) this operater is used to get the reminder.
# lets under stand this by using an example.
8%2

#(**)this operter is usedto get the power of number
2**3

# mutable data type are those from which we an change the the data prest in that data type. like we have an example of list ,
var=['kunal',0.99,'data','science',34,67,23]
var[0]='vishu'
so we can easily change it .


# immutable data type are those type from which we cannot change the element present in it.like we have an example of string.
a='12345678"
a[3]=9
we can not chanege it because it is immutable.
